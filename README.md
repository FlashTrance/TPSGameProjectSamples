# TPSGameProjectSamples
Samples of C++ Code from my WIP independent TPS project in UE4. This is a third-person, cover-based, online multiplayer shooter with working code for cover interaction/movement, weapon handling, AI &amp; EQS systems, and much more. Replication and basic online subsystem integration is also finished.
