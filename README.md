# TPSGameProjectSamples
Samples of C++ Code and Blueprint screenshots from my WIP independent TPS project in UE4 (v4.26).

This is a third-person, cover-based, online multiplayer shooter with working code for cover interaction/movement, weapon handling, AI &amp; EQS systems, and much more. Replication and basic online subsystem integration is also finished. 

A video demonstration of the major features (updated 12/06/21) can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/k0wU2B7o-hc
